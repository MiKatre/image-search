# Image Search CLI Implementation Progress

## Setup & Core Structure âœ…
- [x] Create main image-search executable script
- [x] Set up pyproject.toml for dependency management  
- [x] Fix NumPy compatibility issues
- [x] Test basic CLI help and command structure
- [x] Test database initialization

## Testing Phase ðŸ”„
- [x] Create test directory with sample images
- [x] Test image addition with single image
- [x] Test text-to-image search functionality
- [x] Test image-to-image similarity search
- [x] Test management commands (list, stats, clean)

## Validation & Polish
- [x] Test with multiple images and edge cases
- [x] Verify error handling works properly
- [x] Test recursive directory addition feature
- [x] Final validation of all features
